# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data


```r
data <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "integer"))
attach(data)
summary(data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum, na.rm = TRUE)$steps
hist(stepsPerDay)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png) 


The Mean number of steps per day is:

```r
mean(stepsPerDay)
```

```
## [1] 10766
```


The Median number of steps per day is:

```r
median(stepsPerDay)
```

```
## [1] 10765
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
The daily activity was recorded as interval of 5 minutes
1. Plot
```r
stepsByInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)$steps
plot(stepsByInterval, type = "l")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5.png) 

2. The highest mean steps and the interval with the maximum number of steps

```r
maxInterval = which.max(stepsByInterval)
maxInterval
interval[maxInterval]
```

```
## [1] 104
```

```
## [1] 835
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
